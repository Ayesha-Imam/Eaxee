Developing and maintaining a holistic and end-to-end architectural view of an organization entails the enterprise architects must work on multiple documents and artifacts (including but not limited to process diagrams, catalogs, data models, networks diagrams and strategy documents) that are usually edited and visualized through various productivity tools. The task of keeping consistency and recency of these documents and artifacts becomes a nightmare in the absence of proper enterprise architecture tool. In the following, five benefits are described that suggest the importance of EA tool for enterprise architects.

## Productivity

Enterprise architecture must be considered a key discipline that needs to be taken and managed seriously just like HR, Finance, Sales or Purchasing. Professional sales using a 360-degree client-view or doing purchasing in a smart way are simply not possible without the use of a specialized CRM tool or Purchasing tool, respectively. Administration and management of personnel files and day-to-day operations at the HR department and bookkeeping at the Finance department are almost never done anywhere without an ERP tool. Similarly, to have enterprise architects do their work properly, efficiently, and effectively and to control the volume of produced architecture documents and artifacts it is a wise decision to start using a specialized EA tool at the very beginning of working with enterprise architecture in the organization.

## Consistency

In an enterprise architecture team, domain architects work on architectural fragment that pertains to their domain using various and own methods and techniques. The chances are that created fragments of architecture neither fit with each other nor they can be assembled into one coherent piece of work. By using a specialized EA tool with standardized templates and notations, the architects can be sure that architecture is created, stored, and administered as a consistent and coherent whole. The use of EA Tool brings consistency into models and stimulates reuse of building blocks.

## Reuse

Architectural building blocks that are defined and designed by one architect can be published in a repository in the EA tool for reuse by other architects for elaborating and developing their part of the architecture. Moreover, the presence of an EA tool in organization with stored information allows architects to quickly develop understanding of the AS-IS architecture of the organization at the time of rebuilding the target architecture due to initiation of the new strategic cycle.

## Distribution of Tasks

The distribution of tasks among EA team members becomes much easier with the existence of EA tool. One team member may focus on shapes, definitions and relationships among objects, another team member may create the blueprints and roadmaps. A third one may take care of the underlying metamodels and someone else may work on developing and publishing various dashboards. All this can be carried out consistently and harmoniously due to existence of a single EA repository.

## Costs / Benefits Ratio

It is always justified to invest in an EA tool because of the significantly increased productivity of the EA team. Architects can process architectural changes more quickly, consistently and effectively. The reuse of building blocks is made easier by means of a centralized EA repository. The return on investment (ROI) of an EA Tool is easily achieved, for instance, it prevents stakeholders from looking for hours for a certain document with specific information or using wrong document versions or not finding documents and duplicating existing documents.
